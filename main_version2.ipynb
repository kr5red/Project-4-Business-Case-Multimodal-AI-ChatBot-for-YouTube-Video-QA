An interview can make\\nor break an opportunity. So to help you really prepare, we're going to dissect and\\nanalyze an entire interview from start to finish. I'll be sprinkling in a mix\\nof tips about body language, etiquette, and how to\\nanswer common questions, like when exactly does\\nthe interview start? How do you deal with nerves? And how soon can you follow up? For years, athletes have used\\nscience and data analysis to improve. Now we are doing the same\\nfor job seekers everywhere. This is Job Science. Meet Anya, a\\nrecent grad majoring in business administration. She's interviewing for an\\nentry level project management position. Note her posture. Head up, shoulders pulled back,\\nno slouching, and no laid-backness. The interview begins the minute\\nyou walk into the building. Anya treats everyone in\\nthe office with respect while keeping eye contact. From security personnel\\nto receptionists. Anyone you run\\ninto on your way in could be asked to\\ngive feedback on you. It's normal to be nervous. When nerves kick in, the\\nnatural human response is to take short breaths\\nand breathe faster. Stay calm by taking a deep\\nbreath before entering. Hold it. Count to three and then\\nslowly breathe out. Pause. First, ace those introductions. Greet everyone in a way\\nthat is authentic to you, like, hey, nice to meet you. And then say their name. That one always works. You know you're more\\nlikely to remember their name if you say it out\\nloud when you first meet. A lot of the time, small talk\\ncomes up before any questions. It's good to have a few current\\nevents or topics in mind. You can't possibly predict\\nwhat they're going to ask. But you can practice answering\\nthe common ones like, why do you want to work here? What makes you unique? Let's see what our\\ninterviewer asks. So I want to hear more. Tell me a little\\nabout your experience and what you'd\\nbring to this role? Pause. When this is asked,\\nthey're looking to learn what makes\\nyou stand out. Be honest with your answers. If that means having to pause\\nand think for a second, that is alright. Think about your\\npast experiences and how the role lines up\\nwith your future goals. It never hurts to be honest. Great question. Ever since I was\\nyoung, I've always been the organized\\none of my family, whether it was helping my\\nparents schedule vacations or color-coordinating my closet. Naturally, that lifestyle got\\nme here, project management. I've been a people-person for\\nas long as I can remember. Plain and simple. I love team-building\\nand making sure everyone has a part. Just\\nthe other month-- Ooh, just really quick. Don't speak negatively about\\nprevious places you've worked. Instead, talk about\\nwhat you've learned. I helped lead a team of five\\nto deliver a three-week sales project a few days\\nahead of schedule. I'd love to bring\\nthese things here. Perfect. A response like this not\\nonly answers the question but also shows off\\nher personality. But remember, there's no\\none right way to interview and answer questions. Be yourself, and let\\nyour personality shine. Be aware of your movements.\\nPractice polite, confident body language. Subtly miming your\\ninterviewers posture can actually create a\\nsense of connection. Of all places,\\nunnecessary movements are hard to ignore in an interview. Whether it's tapping your\\nfingers or bouncing your leg, be aware and stay present. Hey, it's been great\\nchatting so far. I guess my last question is, do\\nyou have any questions for me? Oh, this is a hot one. Make sure to have a short list\\nof questions for your employer in your back pocket. Ask the questions you\\nwould if you got the job. If tomorrow was your\\nfirst day what would you want to know\\nfrom the manager. Even if you don't have any\\nburning questions, asking a few shows that you did your homework\\nand that you really care. Some include, what do you\\nlike best about working here? What are some mistakes people\\nhave made in this position? What is a goal you're\\ncurrently working toward? How will my performance\\nbe evaluated? Well, I did read that you're\\nexpanding your software team next quarter. I'm curious how you\\nplan to carry that out. The interview isn't\\nactually over. Always follow up within 24\\nhours with the thank you email to the hiring manager. This can be a quick note simply\\nthanking them for their time. Or a longer one that elaborates\\non some of the things you talked about. It's key to leaving\\na lasting impression. This was the breakdown\\nof an interview. Till next time.
