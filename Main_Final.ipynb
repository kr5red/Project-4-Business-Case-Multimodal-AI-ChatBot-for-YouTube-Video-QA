the ball once we get in there so let's talk about the 12 things you never want to say in an interview but before we get into it if we haven't met my name is Cassandra I'm a career strategist and speaker and I want to talk about all things with your career whether that's job search to promotion and just enjoying the work we do because that's where we spend a lot of our lives so let's talk about those 12 things number 12. please don't ask at the end what would I do in this role huh did you not read the job description did you not do your due diligence now this one and a couple of the others I'm going to talk about it really comes down to the way you're asking something so you can ask about the role in an interview but I wouldn't ask it in terms of like well what would I do in this role I would say something like   I read the job description and I talked to so and so in the department but I would love to hear in your words what you see the day-to-day of this role looking like right that's an informed question instead of just like so what do I do in this that makes people wonder like do   what you're even interviewing for how can you tell me you really want this job   or you're really passionate about it when you don't even know what the role is this next one is honestly one of my personal favorites number 11. oh I can handle any situation this one also gets used a lot in cover letters people be like and I can handle any situation really you can handle any situation so if tomorrow I said I'm bringing in my two pet lions and you need to tame them can you do that like you can't you can be calm Under Pressure but you can't handle any situation let's not put that out there I've worked with some pretty difficult people in my work experience before there are some weird requests out there there are some irrational requests out there don't say you can handle any situation because it's just not true okay number 10 and this is the controversial one let me clarify this because the last time I made a video like this four years ago five years ago people really came for me for it and it's how much does this pay or what's the expected salary now there is a time and place to ask this question I think you can ask on a phone screen about the pay I think you can ask at the end of an interview about it if it hasn't been brought up to you but again it's the way you say it and also I will be honest I think some of it is industry related there are some Industries where it's a super transparent conversation at the very beginning of the interview process and there are other Industries where they are not going to bring it up and they're going to let you go all the way through so if this is something that's really important for you instead of saying well how much would this pay or what would my salary be say something like   I know if we proceed with this interview process this is this can be a long process and I would hate to waste anyone's time so would you be able to give me a bit of the salary range before we even proceed right again that's that's showing hey I'm trying to care about you it's not just about me here I'm trying to care about you too let's not waste anyone's time let's get down to business like let's let's learn this now before we move forward right this is why people sometimes ask on a first date like do you want to have kids because they desperately want to have kids and if the other person doesn't well then we shouldn't do date too like let's get it done now so you can ask about salary it's just how you ask about salary and really thinking through the appropriate time to do it the number nine mistake bashing a bad boss a bad previous boss okay y'all I've had some toxic bosses I've had some great bosses too I know none of my former employers watch these videos yet I always get scared about it that they're gonna be like she talking about me does she think we were all toxic no but I've had a couple of toxic bosses and the interview is not the place to bash them again I'm gonna equate it to dating if you go on a first date with someone who goes on and on essentially about their ex and how terrible they were you don't really know this person on the first date yet are you really judging their ex or are you judging them going they seem to be real hung up on their ex wonder what part they played in this or hmm that doesn't sound as bad as I thought or why are they still talking about that right it's the same thing in an interview you don't want to sit there harping on the bad boss you can in a sophisticated way talk about situations that maybe you didn't see eye to eye with your boss or why you are not the right fit for that situation and why this is a better fit but we don't go on and on about how toxic our boss is because even if it is a thousand percent true they don't know you enough yet to trust your judgment of your old boss all right the next one you want to really avoid sounding cocky in an interview now this is a very fine line confidence is needed in an interview right we want somebody who's confident I think a lot of times confidence actually shows through our passion for the role   the way we lean forward and smile as we're talking about things and then the way we clearly communicate what we do that's confidence cockiness is when we turn subtly into like here's what I did and then I did this other thing and yeah the team was terrible but I did this it's it's a very subtle difference because you are spending time what like 30 minutes to an hour and there could be multiple interviews talking about yourself you're spending all this time talking about yourself but it's the way you talk about yourself that matters so one thing that can really help in seeing where you are on this balance and I fully admit I've accidentally swung into Cockiness before I've had a coach clients where they've swung into Cockiness before the way to get past it is practice practice these answers with a friend and ask them did I sound confident or did I sound cocky have them help you   mold that into a confidence statement and not a cocky statement and if you want more help on this I do interview coaching you can find my link below we can talk all about it okay this next one is another like it's in how you phrase it you don't want to sound for the job you don't want to say something like I really need this job now this is one of those where people want to turn me off and be like who's dumb enough to say that in an interview but there are some of us out there come on friend you and me there are some of us out there who have let nerves take over or we are so desperate for the job that things have come out of our mouths that we know I shouldn't be saying this right now okay I have not actually said this one but there are other things that I've said in interviews that I am saying them my brain is like what are you doing why are you saying this this is not good take it back take it back so while it might seem crazy that someone say someone would say I really need this job people get nervous and they end up saying things they shouldn't so when they say why are you interested in this role or why should we hire you I really need this job   I'm two weeks away from not being able to pay my mortgage my kids school bill is do like we don't say any of that and I have heard people bring in personal reasons like that of why they need the job and why they're interested in it and so you just   want to keep all of that out of it there's a difference between saying I really need this job and sounding passionate and enthusiastic and wanting the job right desperately needing wanting two different things so you want to focus more on saying things like I'm really excited for this opportunity because and talking about why you're excited for it what about the role excites you other than the paycheck oh the next one you don't need to say you're nervous okay they know you're I sound really aggressive when I did that sorry but like they know you're nervous and that's okay I actually think it's healthy if a little bit of nerves show through it shows that you care if you walked in this again is where we can border on cocky when you're leaning back in your seat and you're like yeah let's talk yeah here's why I think gonna be good for it you're a little too chill can come off cocky when you're nervous it it shows that you care about this that you're like I really want to do well so it's okay for some nerves to show through but we don't need to State them they understand that and if they are a good interviewer they are going to try and put you at ease not everyone is a good interviewer I know but don't worry if you're nervous don't get in your head being like Oh my gosh I'm nervous and they can see I'm nervous I look so nervous right now don't worry about it don't worry about it it'll be okay but you don't need a state for the record like sorry I'm just really nervous it's okay the next one is one that really bothers me in the room this is one that I'll be really honest when you hear it you might be like I don't get what's wrong with it but if you've ever been in the room when someone's done it it's real Annoying do not name drop that someone recommended you for the position it's it comes across like you think because this person encouraged you to apply or put in a referral for you that you're owed something it's very weird it's one of those that if you haven't experienced it it's   hard to imagine but I'm just letting   now because I totally get from the interviewee perspective from the candidate perspective you're sitting there thinking oh I need to tell them that so and so said I'd be great for this role that is not gonna go over great in the room what you can do is if they ask you how did you prepare for this interview that is a question some people ask you can talk about how you talk to certain people and name certain people and what they told you about the role and how that made you excited to apply or excited to interview or how that informed you but I have seen multiple candidates before name drop in the room like yeah and so and so and so and so like the the high hiring like the directors of the department they were like and these two told me to apply as they're in a whole room of people including those two people and you could literally watch the whole room tense up and be like oh really like so what so we don't get a say it just is it doesn't work well you might just have to trust me on this one but trust me you don't want a name drop in the room okay the next one is going to be one of those again where you're like who would ever say that I've watched people say some real dumb things again no like when we are nervous we say dumb things if you have never used their product or service if you have never used their software or watched their show or read their blog or whatever don't talk about it don't say oh I never use blah blah blah or   oh I haven't logged on to your software before like no you should have at least tried these things before you did it working in entertainment   if I was interviewing for a TV show that I'd never watched before and those interviews come extremely last minute like hey can you come see us tomorrow I would get home from work and I would watch an hour of that show just so I had some understanding of what it's about right so even if you're not working in television there is a version of this and even if it's not for that specific product you need to think about the industry too so I had people in television script writing classes that would be like oh I never watch TV why are you here like if you don't even watch TV you don't have a passion for the industry why are you trying to learn how to write a TV script that you think other people should read so if you are looking at technology but you're not like keeping up on the latest tech info or you really want to work for a company with a green environmental Mission and you don't really care about the environment don't share that in the interview we gotta like tell them how we care about the same things okay so just use products say you're the same as the mission or just keep your mouth shut like we we need to either go along with the interest or just not say anything at all now in a similar vein this one happens a lot and happens by accident you will be asked something about like have you used our product or what's a favorite one of our product or what's your favorite feature I know Amazon does like a what's your favorite Amazon product or what's your favorite Google Google will do what's your favorite Google feature or product things like that so it doesn't have to be like a con a physical consumer good product or again my intern students I know when they'd interview for certain networks for television they would be asked what's one of your favorite Viacom shows right and then they would say oh I love the Real Housewives well Real Housewives is Bravo and that's owned by NBC Universal it's not owned by Viacom so know who you're talking to and make sure you are familiar with their products so that you can say I like this or this is the feature I like and make sure it's theirs the point of this tip is make sure you're talking about something that's theirs you don't want to interview for Del Taco like Del Taco corporate and then be like what's your favorite food and you're like oh the crunchy gordita and they're like that's Taco Bell they're down the street right so make sure you are talking about the right products and features for the right company it sounds simple but again in the midst of nerves we can lose this one okay I cheated a little bit and this next one is it's not a thing to never say but it's a thing to never do don't leave your phone on during an interview don't just put it to silent the same could be said if it's an if it's an online or a virtual interview same could be said with notifications on your computer turn off your phone turn off notifications because even I have been in so many interviews where someone's phone just started vibrating right like maybe their phone didn't go off maybe they didn't have to say oh sorry about that that would be embarrassing but it kept vibrating every time they got a text message or a ping or somebody just kept trying to call them and we could all hear it and it's super distracting and it can also depending on the person that you're interviewing with and I'll even say depending on their age it could really irritate them and make them think like oh they're not taking this seriously so just turn your phone off on your computer turn all notifications off close all programs everything now ding ding dings for everything so turn it all off and then the last one when they say hey those are all of our questions do you have any questions for us the answer is always yes never say no I'm good I don't think I have any questions thank you for answering everything like no no no you have questions so having questions at the end is showing them that you are genuinely interested in this position and you want to learn more about it more the company more about the role more about the team Etc so you always have questions at the end now I have made a whole slew of videos of questions you can ask at the end of an interview you can start with this one right here and if you need more help I have a free interview prep checklist you can get that in the description box below and I'll see you in the next one bye\",\n          \"3 million that is the number of rums Google receives every year and of those applicants they only hire around 0.2% in this video I'm going to show you how to write a resume that's going to grab any recruiters attention regardless of your professional background this is a Formula that I use to help my clients go from constant rejection to Landing interviews with their dream companies I've spent the last decade working full-time as a technical recruiter and Technical recruiting leader for companies like Google Lyft Uber Tik Tok and the New York Times I reviewed hundreds of thousands of resum\\u00e9s hired hundreds of people and helped many job Seekers succeed so for example my client Cameron was really unhappy in his job didn't even want to go to work wasn't able to get any traction when he would apply to jobs didn't know what to do and after working with me we were able to get him 10 job interviews and he got a job offer in 2 weeks then you have my other client Ravi who was really stuck in his dead end job and really had some long-term goals that he wanted to to get to so after working with me we were able to get him his next job with a $100,000 pay increase and he and his wife were able to pay off their student loan debt so in this video I'm going to break down the formula that I use on my clients to help them revamp their resumes and of course stay until the end cuz then I'm going to give you the good stuff the secret SAU keep watching section one preparation before you start writing your resume it is really important that you do your research and study the market the the reason why is because if you don't do that you're going to fall into this trap that most people fall into which is creating a generic resume in today's job market it is more important than ever to create a resume that is tailored to the job family or job vertical that you're wanting to apply for when you have a generic resume it really makes it difficult for recruiters to really understand who you are and the value that you actually bring to the job and the company that you're applying to so in this first step when you study the Market you're going to make a list first you're going to make a list of the companies that you want to work for then you're going to make a list of the jobs that you want to apply for then you're going to head over to those companies pages and you're going to look at LinkedIn and go scrape those job boards and see what jobs are posted when you go to LinkedIn and you look for jobs you may actually find companies that you weren't really interested in the past or you hadn't thought of but they have a job opening that's really enticing when you do this research what you're going to notice are patterns you're going to find these through points between each of these roles now once you find those through points then you're going to be able to craft a resume that's going to be tailored to those jobs that you want to apply for that way when you do write your resume and you need to tailor it more specifically to the jobs that you're applying for it's only going to take a couple of minutes now once you've completed this step then we can go to the next step which is to build your resume section two Market your personal brand your resume is a document that markets you to potential employers based on your past experience and and achievements it needs to reflect who you are as a business professional so let's talk about the summary section on the rese now I'll be really honest as a recruiter I don't really read summaries I go straight down to the experience section to determine if your experience aligns to the job that you're applying for however if you're in a situation that requires a little bit of extra explanation so for example if you were laid off from your last job you can actually mention that in the summary if you want to relocate you can mention that in the summary you can say open to relocation if you are making a career transition this summary will allow you the opportunity to explain how your skill set aligns to this job that you're applying for so here are the steps to crafting your professional summary who you are professionally begin with a clear statement of your professional capacities for example you can say experienced marketing manager with a proven track record in digital marketing and brand management value proposition and evidence so you're going to follow this with a value proposition that includes evidence so mention specific achievements like successfully let a campaign that boosted social media engagement by 40% you're going to provide evidence early on to substantiate your claims and make your summary much more credible supporting trade or memorable item add a trade or memorable item that makes you stand out like an award or a unique project for example you can say recipient of the 2022 marketing Excellence award for Innovative campaign strategies again avoid generic language like results driven professional or good communicator all of that makes your summary sound super boring and then career goals clearly State why you're applying for the position so for example you can say aiming to apply my expertise in digital marketing to help a dynamic company Drive Innovation and achieve its growth objectives again identify what's going to make you stand out and make you unique and separate yourself from all of the other applicants this could be specific skills or experiences or accomplishments section three achievements highlighting hiring teams want to know what you've accomplished and what business value you're going to bring to that business and the job you're applying for think about Sarah a sales manager initially her resume list of responsibilities like manage sales team and develop sales strategies while these points were true they didn't effectively showcase her business impact now after focusing on her achievements her bullet points read like this increased Regional sales by 25% in one year by implementing new training programs and sales strategies also use numbers whenever possible use percentages or dollar amounts talk about what you increased or decreased so for example you can say increase sales by 20% over a 6-month period which is much more impactful than just saying increase sales now when you're going to describe your achievements you can use a claim evidence approach so what you're going to do is you're going to start with a claim so for example you can say for your claim exceeded annual sales quotas then here's the evidence you can write achieve $22 million against a goal of 20 million in 2020 $25 million against a goal of $23 million in 2021 and on track to hit $32 million against a goal of $30 million in 2022 again what you want to do is you want to highlight the impact in the results of your work companies want to know did you save the company money did you increase profits were you able to increase productivity what were the results of the work that you've done section four skill section this is where a lot of people really mess up because what they end up doing is they end up writing a lot of generic terms like good communicator now you don't need to list every single skill that you have instead list the skills that you have that are relevant to the position that you're applying to so for example if you use specific tools let's say Google analytics or Salesforce CRM make sure you list those as well now depending on the job you're applying for when you're reading that job description see if they make mention of your proficiency level in those tools so for example let's say you're applying for a role as a senior business data analyst and Excel is something that you need to have for your job what you can write in your skills section is advanced in Excel section five professional experience now this is my favorite part of a resume because this is where you get to really showcase and highlight who you are and the impact that you've had on a business business what you want to do is in your experience section you want to write out bullet points because it's a lot easier for the person reading your resume to be able to read it an easy way to write your results on your resume is to use the Google XYZ formula the Google XYZ formula States accomplished X as measured by y by doing Z and here's an example you can say increased Regional sales by 25% by implementing a new training program and sales strategies resulting in a $1.2 million Revenue increase and again what you want to do is when you've done your research and you've read the job description align what you've read in the job description to what it is that they're looking for in the experience that you've had and so that way you can craft your Google XYZ formulas to align with the jobs and your experience so here's a before and after transformation so you can see another example so before responsible for overseeing marketing campaigns after directed a marketing campaign that increased website traffic by 30% within 3 months by implementing targeted SEO strategies section six education education is where you're going to list any education that you have outside of any type of certifications when you list out your education you want to name the institution that you went to the degree that you received and any relevant coursework that you took that is relevant to the job that you're applying for also if you are a newer graduate meaning you've graduated in the past 3 years what you want to do is you want to include your graduation dates and on your resume move move your education to the very top of the resume underneath your contact information the reason why is because that will easily indicate to the recruiter that you're a newer graduate if you're beyond 3 years then what you do is move your education section to after your experience section and remove your dates of graduation here's an example of how you can write your education on your resume University of California Berkeley Bachelor of Arts and marketing graduated 2022 honors Magnum Kare relevant coursework digital marketing consumer Behavior market research now if you do have any certifications you can either create a new section titled certifications and you can include it there or if you want to put it into your education section let's say cuz do formatting wise you want to make sure it fits then at the top of the section just say education and certifications then you're going to list out all of your certifications and if any of those certifications have any type of IDs go ahead and leave those there and if there're any external links to those certifications so that the recruiter can click on it then include those as well section seven final touches formatting again another favorite I feel like every section is my favorite but no but really it's my favorite now the key to formatting is you want it to be simple and easy to read and make sure it's easily scannable now I know that there are websites like canva and on Etsy where you can get resum\\u00e9 templates even though canva offers r\\u00e9 templates I do not not recommend them yes they are beautiful and by the way I subscribe to canva I think it's an awesome tool I use it for so many things but when it comes to resum\\u00e9 templates I do not recommend it here's why most of the time when you are downloading these resum\\u00e9 templates a lot of them have clip art and bar graphs and place for your head shot and it really detracts and takes away from your resume so I know that people look at RS as a marketing document but it's not really a marketing document in that way give me an example I'll see a resume and it'll say like in a skill section it'll say Excel then it'll have some dots next to it and I'm like what do those dots mean I have no idea it's like an interpretive dance I don't know what it means you don't want to confuse the recruiter or the hiring manager so it's better to just be clear keep it super simple so here are some tips to write a simple and cleanly designed resume we're going to start with fonts my favorite fonts to use are Ariel and calbri I use cbri more than aiel both of them are great I've seen Times New Roman actually making a comeback and it's Chic I dig it consistent layout you need to make sure that you have your headings fonts and spacing are consistent throughout the resume it's going to make it look more polished and more presentable bullet points when you are using bullet points to period or not to period that is the question it's more of a taste thing some people say no periods some people say yes periods it doesn't really matter if you use periods or not what does matter is you're doing it consistently throughout the resume now bold for emphasis sprinkle a little bold around here and there to emphasize things like where you've worked the dates that you've worked Etc consistent contact information so up at the very top of your resume you want to make sure that you're very clear about who you are so you're going to have your name your location your phone pH number your email address your LinkedIn link and any other relevant link so for example if you're a designer if you're in creative and you have outside portfolios include those Links at the very top of your resume and of course spell check proofread true story when I worked at Google one of my hiring managers rejected a candidate and I didn't catch it but the resume had a spelling mistake and the hiring manager literally said this person does not pay attention to detail I will not be considering them take it from me take it from that experience better to spell check save as a PDF save your resume as a PDF when you save your file as a PDF and you are applying to jobs it will maintain the Integrity of the resume so it's going to look the same on your screen as it is going to look the same on the other person's screen now the most important part here are things to avoid so you want to avoid images Graphics any type of clip art columns and tables now the the reason why you want to remove columns and tables is that there are some applicant tracking systems that cannot read those so for example work day cannot read a resume that is more than a single column so if you have a two column resume it's not going to be able to catch all that data and extract that text section eight tailoring you don't have to rewrite your resume every time you apply to a job what we just did is we've created a resume for you that's very targeted to the type of jobs you want to apply for and the type of jobs you want to apply for really have to be in a singular vertical or a singular job family then what you do is when you did that research like you did at the very beginning before you wrote your resume now you're going to go to those job postings now you're going to look at those and you are going to put the job posting next to your resume and you're going to look at them side by side and you are going to see what parts of your resume are the same as the job description and what things are different and of those things that are different you're going to include clude those into your resume and make sure that it is very crystal clear on your resume that you are a fit for that position now a common misconception that I need to talk about are applicant tracking systems applicant tracking systems are also known as ATS systems companies will license an applicant tracking system and what this is It's a digital filing cabinet and it's built on really old Legacy technology that's 20 years old so when you are applying to a role what what the recruiter has done is they've gone into the applicant tracking system and through the system they're able to post the job on their careers page and several external job boards let's say LinkedIn or indeed now the mistake that a lot of people make is they'll say I need to find all the keywords in a job description and I just need to throw them in my resume and we call that keyword stuffing that does not work because people think I need to beat an ATS listen the ATS is a digital filing cabinet there ain't nothing to beat you mind want to try to kick it down the road but I ain't going to work so the reality is this when you apply to a position we use First in first out logic so when you apply to a job if you are the first one to apply your resume will show up first now when you apply to a job on the technical side of things here's what happens when you apply to a job you apply to a job you basically get a profile that's created in the applicant tracking system for you and it'll show the jobs that you've applied for so when I is a recruit go to pull up your application it's going to show me your resume and any other input that you manually inputed the questions about like your racial identity thing your veteran status disability status that is actually not something that recruiters can see that is information that goes directly to the Department of Labor those just don't show up there are a lot of career coaches people who have never actually worked in recruiting who will say things like throw as many keywords into your resume as possible so that way you can beat the ATS or the worst one I've ever seen is they'll say take the job description copy it paste it into your resume and put it in white font so that way the comp the the Bots can read it the AI can read it like no that just makes your resume look silly like even if you put it in point4 font that just doesn't work come on that is not what is happening instead of stuffing your resume with keywords what you want to do is you do want to recognize what those keywords are but you want to Pepper them throughout your resume thoughtfully for the human reader because it's a human that's actually going to read and scan your resume true story I once had a resume that was submitted for a marketing director it was over 20 pages long two Z the resume had all these keywords stuffed in the border on the right hand side it was that was the weirdest resume I've ever seen in my life let's just not do that here's the secret to avoid the biggest mistake the truth is that as I was in the process of editing my video I realized that the secret that I gave you wasn't actually the best secret so here's the best secret what I want you to do is picture this let's look at this analogy imagine you made dinner reservations at a restaurant and you go to the restaurant and you sit down and when you sit down the waiter gives you a menu and the menu says stainless steel utensils Teakwood Furniture porcelain plates you'd be confused right and you're confused because you think yeah of course you have these are basic expectations because you're at a restaurant it's not like they're going to go make food and put the food in your hand they're going to serve it to you on a plate and give you utensils to eat the food with and you see this a lot with resum\\u00e9s where people will write things like pays attention to detail excellent Communicator works well in teams remember these are just basic expectations when you work in a job it's not something that you need to put on your resume what we want to do is you want to think of the job description as the menu that you're receiving so when you get that menu what dish do you want to order so study the menu carefully and understand what that position calls for then describe how your background is that succulent delicious dish that they've been craving so don't sell the plate and the silverware sell the sizzle I just realize I didn't have my camera on what\",\n          \"hi folks my name is Aaron mcgoff I'm a filmmaker and content creator living in New York and I have helped literally millions of people nail their job interviews and today I'm here to help   you so if you clicked on this video I'm going to assume that you have a job interview coming up and if that's the case let me be the first person to congratulate you getting to the interview stage is a huge accomplishment not only did you write a stellar enough application to get through the applicant tracking system and in front of a real human being but they also looked at your and thought Yep this person might be the one let's bring them in for an interview companies don't waste their time interviewing people that they don't think might be the perfect fit for the role so pat yourself on the back it's a huge accomplishment just to get an interview okay so they already love you but now we just got to seal the deal and if you're already watching this video and putting in time and effort to prepare for your interview I feel like you actually have nothing to worry about it seems like this company would be lucky to have you but regardless I'm going to run you through my six-step process to make sure that you nail this interview Step One is mindset your mindset going into a job interview is so so important most people think of it like this I'm so grateful the company wants to interview me but like what if I go in and I mess up and I'm not what they're looking for and I'm just not good enough for them no no no no no no no excuse me let's flip that around is this company good enough for you is this role something that you're even interested in interviews go both ways okay this company might not be the vibe for you you are not desperate you are not looking for someone to give you a handout to give you a chance you are highly skilled you are a professional you have good character character you have good work ethic you are collaborative you are communicative if this company hired you they would be making a smart choice remember the person who is conducting your interview wants to hire you their job is to hire quality candidates to put in the company if you come in and you are that amazing candidate that they want to hire they look good to their boss they are not looking for reasons to reject you they are looking for reasons to hire you so just walk in there and confirm to them that you are the perfect person for this role because in that case they're down with work for the day they can go home and relax just walk into that interview and be their ideal candidate be the solution to all their problems step two review the job description your first interview at most companies is going to be a filtering interview meaning that you're probably not going to interview with your future boss but rather with somebody from the HR or hiring department they are not going to be super familiar with the ins and outs of your role they're probably not going to understand a lot of the jargon that you would use on your daily job and they're honestly not looking to be impressed by your thorough skills or knowledge what they are looking for is to check off boxes on a list most of those boxes are keywords they are listening to hear if you repeat the keywords in the job description so if the job is looking for an editor who knows Premiere Pro and Avid you better say I know Premiere Pro and Avid very well and they're going to go check check   and other things on the checklist are is this person a psychopath no does this person smell weird no did this person show up on time yes so all you need to do is help them check off their little boxes so before your first interview I want you to go back and reread the job description and then take the 10 15 most common job interview questions and script out your answers for each one using words in the job description then you want to practice them through enough so that you don't sound scripted but that you sound prepared and if you need some extra help I'll link to my job interview Q&A templates down in the description also Pro tip sometimes companies will ask very specific questions if you feel like you're so in the dark and you have no idea what this company's going to ask you I highly recommend going to glore.com looking up the company clicking on interviews and then people will write reports of their interview experience at that company and sometimes people will even write specific questions that they were asked so that's a great way to   get an idea of what   questions they're going to ask in the interview another Pro tip is that you want to have a lot of stories prepared so companies might ask you what was a time that you overcame an obstacle tell me about a time that you achieved something at tell me about a time that you disagreed with a coworker or my favorite one tell me about a time you failed gosh I hate that question again I have templated answers to all of these questions on my Tik Tok and Instagram so be sure to follow me there step three is research the next step involves heavily researching the company but this shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes to an hour the first place that you want to start is the company website you want to go and read their about or their mission or their value or their careers page you want to get a sense of their values as a company so that you can use those in your answers also the careers page can be a great place to learn about the benefits that they publicly offer so that if you're curious about their for onek match or their paid maternity leave you can see if you can find the answers there and then ask about them in the interview that's a really delicate way of going about that next you're going to want to go over to Google and type in the company name and then click on the news tab read about any recent news for the company or for the industry as a whole did the company recently win any awards did the company recently have a merger was there a wave of layoff This research will truly come in handy when you have to ask questions at the end of the interview which we're going to talk about and lastly you're going to want to go over to my friend LinkedIn if you don't already have a LinkedIn profile definitely create one it's super easy and a great great tool to have if   the name of the person who is interviewing you feel free to look them up and browse their profile a quick tip if you don't know LinkedIn that well but whenever you look at somebody's profile they will actually receive a notification that you looked at their profile so definitely don't go around sleuthing your ex's profiles because guess they will know but don't be afraid to look at the person who's going to be interviewing you because one they might not check LinkedIn so they might not even know where care but two if they do see it they'll think wow this person is very proactive they're doing their research that's a good thing but I don't know about y'all with LinkedIn but I don't remember the last time that like I actually looked at who looked at my profile maybe I maybe I should that maybe that would be maybe that would be interesting but it's not super common after that go over and type in the company name into LinkedIn and then you can browse the company's page I recommend clicking on the people Tab and browsing the people that work there see if anybody who works there maybe has a mutual connection with you or maybe if they went to the same University or were in the same club or from the same Hometown and if you find somebody who does have a similar connection with you please message them click connect and then click add note and then just say something like hi Adam my name is Aaron I also went to American University I graduated in 2017 I'm interviewing at your company next week do you have any tips for me guys an inside referral is a super weapon when it comes to getting a job having somebody on the inside vouch for you is like 10 extra super points in a video game I don't know if that was a good metaphor but it's really powerful it's like supercharging your application like I tell everybody the best way to get a job the best way to get a good job is to get an internal referral anyway getting distracted back to the Steps step four prepare questions at the end of the interview they're going to ask you so do you have any questions for us and the only wrong answer is no you should always have about four to five questions prepared for the end of the interview the more specific the questions the better some questions like who will I be reporting to in this role or what's the single most important soft skill that someone in this role needs to succeed if you need more inspiration for amazing questions to ask go watch this video that I uploaded and I have a ton of examples for you but again the more specific the question the better for example I recently saw that your competitor released a sustainable product line will this company be following suit questions that are really specific And Timely and show that you're thinking about the company as a whole are like golden step five we're almost there I promise prepare your interview outfit one of the most simple rules for dressing and job interviews is that you can't be overdressed but you can be underdressed so it's always better to air on the side of overdressed what you're wearing doesn't matter as much as your hygiene so you need to make sure that you don't smell your clothes are stain free they're wrinkle-free and they are tailored for your body now of course what you wear varies per industry if you are interviewing for a legal firm you're going to want to wear something more conservative like a black gray or brown suit however if you're interviewing for a creative position at a tech company where everybody wears their pajamas then maybe business casual is best maybe some nice black jeans and a blazer if you don't know what to wear the general rule is that you wear basically One Step Up from what the employees of the company wear so if the companies wear a uniform you would want to wear business casual if the employees were business casual then you would want to wear a business formal and if the employees are business formal then you would want to wear a tuxedo just kidding just kidding that's the last one it ends up business formal and it's almost always safe to wear something between business casual and business formal like a nice relaxed suit or a simple business dress is always a good idea you always want to air on the side of modesty and conservative because you never know who's going to be interviewing you and you don't want to bet against yourself if you're wondering where to shop some good budget options are TJ Maxx Kohl's Marshalls Target H&M is actually really fantastic and then if you're looking for more mid-range I personally really like everlane and abber cromi but some other good ones are Nordstrom Nordstrom wre Banana Republic bobos and Taylor Express and then   big department stores like Macy's but it's really important that whatever you do buy needs to fit you the fit is almost more important than the clothes if you're wearing something that's too baggy or too tight it might communicate to the employer that you are unprofessional and of course we don't want that because you are professional and you're desirable and they'd be lucky to have you remember okay and the last step step six do a mock interview okay so lastly if you have time I highly recommend doing a mock interview with a family member or a friend but it's important it has to be somebody who's not afraid to be honest with you and give you real feedback so don't do it with your mom who's just going to say oh honey that was so great like no Mom we're not doing that do it with somebody who's going to roast you do it with somebody who's going to say you were fidgeting that whole time you were playing with your hair you didn't make eye contact with me one time I want you to go through the whole thing get dressed up go in no notes have them ask you the questions you have to give the answers and then each time I want them to give you feedback and tell you the truth because research says that 65% of what we communicate is through our body language it's so important to gain self-awareness and the only way to really do that is by talking to somebody else who can reveal to us our own blind spots and behaviors all right that's it for me today I am so so excited please let me know how it goes down in the comments and save this video for future use   share it with your nieces or nephew or your friends remember you got this and I'll see you next time  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Today, our goal is to actually source real time what the actual interviews look like at these top tech companies. And we have over 5,000 plus companies on our platform. We've just rolled out our AI powered mock interviews that adapt to your skill level in real time. And our company specific question bank makes banks now track what Google, Meta, and Amazon are actually asking right now, updated monthly based on real candidate feedback. Plus, our new AI coding assistant helps you practice working with AI tools during technical problems, so you're ready for companies that embrace the new reality. You can practice with our live mock interview feature with real engineers, get detailed feedback on your system design thinking, and access our behavioral interview simulator that preps you for those crucial leadership questions. I've been working on interview query for 6 years now and the most important thing I think is to find an easy cheap solution that you can practice on your own. Our goal at the end of the day is to personalize your interview experience depending on your background whether you're entry level or very senior candidate and we're getting closer and closer to that with a lot of the AI tools that we're releasing.

It’s a software companies use to automatically scan, sort and filter resumes before a human ever sees them.\n","Answer: An ATS, or Applicant Tracking System, is a tool used by companies to scan, sort, rank, and filter resumes based on specific criteria. These systems help streamline the hiring process by saving time and identifying the best candidates. However, if a resume is not optimized for the ATS, it may never be seen by human recruiters, even if the applicant is a perfect fit for the job. Therefore, formatting and presenting resume information in a way that is easy for the ATS to read and process is crucial.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.821\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the speaker say it matters when you write a resume?\n","Expected: It matters because even if you’re a great candidate, if your resume isn’t optimized for ATS (format, keywords, layout), it may get filtered out and you might never reach a recruiter.\n","Answer: The speaker emphasizes that writing a resume matters because it is crucial to effectively communicate your experience and impact to potential employers. They highlight that simply listing responsibilities is not enough; instead, you should transform those into compelling impact statements that showcase your achievements and the value you can bring to an organization. For mid-career professionals, having a two-page resume is often necessary to adequately convey their extensive experience and leadership capabilities. Additionally, the speaker stresses the importance of a polished and consistent layout, attention to detail (like spelling), and including relevant links, as these elements contribute to making a strong impression on hiring managers. Overall, a well-crafted resume can significantly increase your chances of being noticed and considered for an interview.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.524\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the video recommend doing at the very top of your resume, just under your contact info?\n","Expected: You should place the exact job title you’re applying for at the top. Right under it, include a 'power-packed trio' or more key skills that match those from the job description. This helps show alignment with the role and helps the ATS pick them up.\n","Answer: The video recommends that if you are a newer graduate (meaning you graduated in the past 3 years), you should include your graduation dates and move your education section to the very top of the resume, just underneath your contact information. This placement helps indicate to the recruiter that you are a newer graduate. If you are beyond 3 years, you should move your education section to after your experience section and remove your graduation dates.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.429\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How should you format your resume to make it 'ATS-friendly,' according to the video?\n","Expected: Use a simple, clean layout with no graphics, tables, columns, or complex formatting. Stick to standard fonts and standard section headings so the ATS can read everything correctly.\n","Answer: To format your resume to make it 'ATS-friendly,' you should follow these guidelines:\n","\n","1. **Simplicity is Key**: Use straightforward formatting without complex graphics, tables, or fancy design elements, as these can confuse the ATS.\n","\n","2. **Use Standard Formatting**: Stick to bullet points, clear headings, and standard text alignment. Choose professional fonts like Cambria, Calibri, or Arial, and keep the font size at least 11 points for readability.\n","\n","3. **Include Standard Sections**: Your resume should have standard sections such as contact information, professional summary, work experience, education and training, and skills. Use conventional titles like \"Work Experience\" instead of creative ones that the ATS might not recognize.\n","\n","4. **Text Alignment and Consistency**: Align your text to the left and maintain consistent formatting for dates, locations, and job titles to keep your resume organized.\n","\n","5. **File Format**: Save your resume as a Word document or a plain PDF format. Avoid using images, special characters, or embedded graphics, as these can disrupt the ATS's ability to scan your resume correctly.\n","\n","6. **Clarity and Functionality**: Ensure that your resume is clear and functional, making it easy for both the ATS and recruiters to read.\n","\n","By adhering to these guidelines, you can enhance the chances of your resume passing the ATS screening process and being seen by recruiters.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.697\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the video suggest turning your resume into a 'highlight reel,' and how can you do that?\n","Expected: Because resumes should show measurable impact, not just tasks. You can do this by writing achievement-focused bullet points that emphasize results, numbers, and your contribution to past roles.\n","Answer: The video suggests turning your resume into a 'highlight reel' to ensure that it stands out to employers and applicant tracking systems (ATS). A highlight reel is more than just a list of jobs; it should be a compelling showcase of your professional achievements that clearly demonstrates why you are the best choice for a position.\n","\n","To create a highlight reel, you can follow these steps:\n","\n","1. **Analyze the Job Description**: Use your AI assistant to identify and highlight the key skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job you are applying for.\n","\n","2. **Be Selective**: Focus on showcasing only the skills and experiences that closely match the job requirements. Cut out any information that does not add value to your application.\n","\n","3. **Use Bullet Points**: Highlight each position with bullet points that feature the keywords and skills identified from the job description. This makes it easier for ATS to recognize your qualifications.\n","\n","4. **Showcase Achievements**: Instead of listing tasks, describe your achievements in a way that reflects the impact you had. Use specific metrics or outcomes to substantiate your claims, making your contributions tangible.\n","\n","5. **Tell a Compelling Narrative**: Infuse your bullet points with energy and personality. Instead of just stating facts, convey how your experiences felt and what you learned, connecting with the reader on a human level.\n","\n","By transforming your resume into this engaging format, you can effectively communicate your potential and make a strong impression on potential employers.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.614\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What is the main goal the recruiter recommends your resume should achieve before a human reads it?\n","Expected: The resume should grab the recruiter's attention and get past any initial filters, making it stand out even if you don’t have a traditional background.\n","Answer: The main goal the recruiter recommends your resume should achieve before a human reads it is to pass the initial screening by the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This involves ensuring that your resume is formatted correctly, contains relevant keywords, and presents information in a clear and organized manner. The resume should be optimized for quick scanning by the ATS, which means it should be easy for the system to read and interpret, allowing it to make it past the initial scan and reach the recruiter.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.616\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How does the video suggest you structure the top of your resume (headline & summary) for maximum impact?\n","Expected: You should start with a clear headline or job title you are applying for, followed by a brief, compelling summary that highlights your most relevant skills and value — tailored to the job.\n","Answer: The video suggests that to structure the top of your resume for maximum impact, you should lead with a powerful summary that highlights what makes you unique and positions you for the role you want. Instead of using generic phrases like \"results-driven professional,\" you should provide specific details about your accomplishments. For example, instead of saying \"results-driven professional,\" you could say something like \"Finance director with 12 years scaling revenue operations from 50 million to 200 million across Fortune 500 companies.\" This approach not only makes your summary stand out but also provides tangible evidence of your achievements, which is attractive to hiring managers. Additionally, it's important to own your accomplishments and substantiate them with facts that you can discuss in interviews, as hiring decisions are based on delivering results rather than humility.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.609\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What type of content does the recruiter recommend emphasising in the work-experience section to make it memorable?\n","Expected: Focus on achievements and impact rather than just listing duties — use metrics or concrete results to show what you actually accomplished.\n","Answer: The recruiter recommends emphasizing results and impact in the work-experience section of your resume to make it memorable. Instead of simply listing responsibilities, you should focus on showcasing the outcomes of your work and how it contributed to the bigger picture. This approach not only breathes life into your experiences but also connects with the reader on a human level, making your professional narrative more compelling. For example, instead of stating \"managed marketing campaigns,\" you could say something like \"spearheaded a high impact team project that streamlined processes, cutting delivery time by 30% and boosting client satisfaction.\" This way, your resume reflects your achievements and the value you can bring to a potential employer.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.653\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why is tailoring your resume to the specific job description important, according to the video?\n","Expected: Because it ensures that your skills, experience and language match what the recruiter is looking for — increasing chances to catch their attention and pass automated or human screening.\n","Answer: Tailoring your resume to the specific job description is important because it helps you align your skills and experiences with what the employer is looking for. By mirroring the exact language from the job description, you increase the chances that your resume will be recognized by applicant tracking systems (ATS) that many companies use to screen candidates. This targeted approach ensures that your resume highlights relevant skills and accomplishments, making it more likely to catch the attention of recruiters and hiring managers. Additionally, it allows you to present your professional narrative in a way that demonstrates how you can meet the specific needs of the role, ultimately improving your chances of securing an interview.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.63\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What should you avoid in resume formatting to make sure it works well for both recruiters and applicant-tracking systems?\n","Expected: Avoid overly fancy formatting, complex layouts or unnecessary graphics — keep it clean, simple and easy to read so both ATS and human recruiters can parse it correctly.\n","Answer: To ensure your resume works well for both recruiters and applicant-tracking systems (ATS), you should avoid the following formatting elements:\n","\n","1. **Complex Graphics and Tables**: These can confuse the ATS and may cause it to misread or skip important details. Stick to straightforward formatting.\n","\n","2. **Images and Clip Art**: These elements are often not readable by ATS and can disrupt the parsing of your resume.\n","\n","3. **Columns**: Many ATS cannot read resumes formatted with multiple columns. It's best to use a single-column format to ensure all information is captured correctly.\n","\n","4. **Fancy Design Elements**: Avoid decorative fonts and hard-to-read text. Use professional fonts like Cambria, Calibri, or Arial, and keep the font size at least 11 points.\n","\n","5. **Unconventional Headings**: Use clear, conventional titles for sections (e.g., \"Work Experience\" instead of \"My Career Highlights\") to ensure the ATS recognizes them.\n","\n","6. **Special Characters**: These can also confuse the ATS, so it's best to avoid them.\n","\n","7. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Ensure consistent formatting for dates, locations, and job titles to keep your resume organized and easily readable.\n","\n","By following these guidelines, you can improve the chances of your resume being accurately processed by ATS and effectively reviewed by recruiters.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.754\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the recruiter say about the importance of clarity and simplicity in your resume?\n","Expected: She emphasizes that clarity and simplicity help recruiters quickly understand who you are and what you offer without being distracted by unnecessary details.\n","Answer: The recruiter emphasizes that clarity and simplicity are crucial when formatting your resume, particularly for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). They advise against using complex graphics, tables, and fancy design elements, as these can confuse the ATS and lead to misreading or skipping important details. Instead, a straightforward format with bullet points, clear headings, and standard text alignment is recommended. The recruiter suggests using professional fonts like Cambria, Calibri, or Arial, and keeping the font size at least 11 points for readability. Additionally, they stress the importance of using conventional titles for sections and maintaining consistent formatting throughout the resume to ensure it is organized and easily parsed by both the ATS and human readers. Overall, the focus should be on making the resume easy to read and scannable.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.573\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the video recommend avoiding long paragraphs in your resume?\n","Expected: Because recruiters skim resumes, and long paragraphs make it harder to quickly identify key achievements and skills.\n","Answer: The video recommends avoiding long paragraphs in your resume because they can make it difficult for hiring managers to quickly scan and identify key information. Instead, it suggests using concise bullet points that clearly outline specific achievements and responsibilities. This approach helps to present information in a more digestible format, making it easier for the reader to see the impact of your work and qualifications at a glance.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.673\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the recruiter suggest you should do when you don’t meet 100% of the job requirements?\n","Expected: You should still apply, highlighting transferable skills and achievements that show your ability to learn and adapt.\n","Answer: The recruiter suggests that you should not feel discouraged if you don't meet 100% of the job requirements. Instead, you should focus on the skills and experiences you do have that align with the role. It's important to remember that interviews go both ways, and you should assess whether the company and the role are a good fit for you as well. You are a skilled professional, and the interviewer is looking for reasons to hire you, not to reject you. Therefore, approach the interview with confidence, highlighting how you can be the ideal candidate for the position.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.506\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How does the speaker recommend using keywords in your resume?\n","Expected: Use keywords that match the job description naturally within your experience and skills so your resume aligns with what recruiters and ATS are scanning for.\n","Answer: The speaker recommends using keywords in your resume strategically to optimize it for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and to appeal to human recruiters. Here are the key points:\n","\n","1. **Identify Relevant Keywords**: Start by analyzing the job description to find specific skills, qualifications, and terms that the employer emphasizes. These keywords are crucial as they are what the ATS is programmed to detect.\n","\n","2. **Weave Keywords Naturally**: Instead of randomly scattering keywords throughout your resume, integrate them into your bullet points and accomplishments in a way that feels natural and impactful. For example, if \"process improvement\" is a key skill, illustrate it with a specific achievement, such as \"implemented process improvements that reduced project turnaround time by 30%.\"\n","\n","3. **Tell a Story**: Think of your resume as a narrative that showcases your professional journey, guided by these keywords. Each bullet point should not only reflect your skills but also demonstrate the results you've achieved by using those skills.\n","\n","4. **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**: The speaker warns against stuffing your resume with keywords in a way that makes it difficult to read. Instead, keywords should be peppered throughout the resume thoughtfully for both the ATS and the human reader.\n","\n","By following these guidelines, you can create a resume that is both ATS-friendly and appealing to recruiters.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.745\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the video say about customizing bullet points for each job application?\n","Expected: The recruiter advises tailoring your bullet points to emphasize the accomplishments and skills most relevant to the specific role.\n","Answer: The video emphasizes the importance of customizing bullet points for each job application to ensure relevance and impact. It suggests that you should highlight each position with bullet points that feature the keywords and skills identified in the job description. The video advises against listing everything from your work history, especially if it doesn't align with the targeted job, as it can be considered noise by applicant tracking systems (ATS). Instead, you should craft bullet points that tell a story of impact, quantifying achievements where possible. For example, instead of simply stating \"managed project timelines,\" you could say \"managed project timelines reducing delivery time by 30% and saving $50k annually.\" This approach not only makes your resume more appealing to ATS but also resonates with recruiters by showcasing your contributions effectively.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.706\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the recruiter emphasize showing measurable achievements?\n","Expected: Because numbers make your impact concrete and credible, helping you stand out by demonstrating real results instead of vague statements.\n","Answer: The recruiter emphasizes showing measurable achievements because it helps to clearly communicate the impact of a candidate's contributions. By including specific metrics, such as percentages or dollar amounts, candidates can demonstrate their effectiveness and the tangible results of their work. This is important because hiring teams want to understand the business value a candidate can bring to the organization. For example, instead of simply stating responsibilities, candidates should highlight achievements like \"increased regional sales by 25% in one year,\" which provides concrete evidence of their capabilities and success. This approach not only makes the resume more impactful but also helps recruiters quickly assess a candidate's qualifications and potential fit for the role.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.627\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What advice is given about including soft skills on a resume?\n","Expected: Soft skills should be demonstrated through accomplishments and outcomes, not just listed as adjectives.\n","Answer: The advice given about including soft skills on a resume emphasizes the importance of being specific and relevant rather than using generic terms. Instead of simply listing soft skills like \"good communicator,\" it's recommended to highlight skills that are directly relevant to the position you are applying for. Additionally, when mentioning these skills, it's beneficial to provide context or examples that demonstrate how you've applied them effectively in past roles. This approach helps to create a more compelling narrative that showcases your professional journey and the impact you've had, rather than just a collection of buzzwords.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.615\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the video suggest you do if you have employment gaps?\n","Expected: Be honest and confident; briefly explain what you were doing during the gap, such as learning new skills, caregiving, or personal projects.\n","Answer: The retrieved context does not specifically address how to handle employment gaps in your resume. However, it emphasizes the importance of showcasing relevant skills and experiences that match the job you are applying for. If you have employment gaps, it may be beneficial to focus on highlighting your skills, problem-solving abilities, and any relevant experiences that demonstrate your potential to grow into the position, rather than dwelling on the gaps themselves. For more tailored advice, you might consider consulting a career expert or using resources like the career advancement toolkit mentioned in the videos.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.587\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What is the recruiter's recommendation regarding resume length?\n","Expected: Keep it concise — typically one page for early-career professionals and up to two pages for more experienced candidates.\n","Answer: The recruiter recommends that mid-career professionals should use a two-page resume instead of a one-page resume. They argue that a one-page resume does not adequately convey the level of experience and leadership that someone with 15 or more years of experience possesses. A two-page resume allows for a more comprehensive presentation of relevant and interesting information that can compel hiring managers to read it thoroughly.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.695\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the recruiter say about using templates or overly designed resumes?\n","Expected: She advises avoiding overly designed templates because they can confuse ATS systems and distract from the content that matters most.\n","Answer: The recruiter advises against using templates or overly designed resumes, stating that complex graphics, tables, and fancy design elements can confuse applicant tracking systems (ATS), causing them to misread or skip important details. Instead, they recommend sticking to straightforward formatting with bullet points, clear headings, and standard text alignment. The focus should be on simplicity and readability to ensure that the ATS can accurately process the information in the resume.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.754\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What major shift happened in tech interviews after the release of ChatGPT in late 2022?\n","Expected: ChatGPT became capable of solving almost any coding interview question, leading to widespread AI-assisted cheating and forcing companies to rethink their interview processes.\n","Answer: After the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, a major shift occurred in tech interviews where companies began testing candidates on their ability to work with AI, specifically by evaluating how well candidates could identify and correct mistakes in AI-generated code. This change reflected a broader trend where companies started to incorporate AI tools into the interview process, moving away from traditional coding assessments to more practical, real-world problem-solving scenarios. For example, companies like OpenAI and Stripe began using take-home challenges that allowed candidates to utilize various tools, including AI, to demonstrate their architectural decisions, documentation skills, and problem-solving abilities. This shift also led to an \"arms race\" between companies trying to catch candidates who might be using AI to cheat, resulting in increasingly complex interview problem sets.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.747\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why have many tech companies begun increasing surveillance and anti-cheating mechanisms during interviews?\n","Expected: Because a growing number of candidates secretly use AI tools during interviews, with some companies like Amazon seeing up to 50% suspected AI usage.\n","Answer: Many tech companies have started increasing surveillance and anti-cheating mechanisms during interviews due to a significant rise in candidates using sophisticated AI tools to cheat. Reports indicate that a conservative estimate suggests one in ten candidates are using some form of AI assistance during interviews, with some companies like Amazon seeing up to 50% of users engaging in secret AI usage. This has led to a full-blown arms race between companies trying to catch cheaters and candidates employing increasingly advanced methods to game the system.\n","\n","To combat this, companies are implementing measures such as keeping cameras on at all times, requiring screen sharing, and using advanced proctoring techniques like eye tracking, copy-paste detection, and screen recording. The situation has become so serious that some companies are even reverting to pedigree-based hiring practices, relying on brand name signals from top colleges and prestigious companies, as traditional skill-based assessments have become compromised. The overall goal is to restore trust in the hiring process and ensure that candidates are genuinely qualified.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.763\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What strategy is Meta using to design interview questions that are harder for AI to answer?\n","Expected: Meta gives multi-step product and data problems that build on previous answers, requiring ongoing reasoning and product thinking rather than standalone code generation.\n","Answer: Meta is employing a strategy that focuses on creating complex, interconnected problems that require deep product thinking and analytical reasoning, rather than straightforward code generation. For example, they present candidates with scenarios that involve data analysis for an Instagram shop, asking them to brainstorm ways to improve the product and analyze low conversion rates. This approach necessitates building upon previous answers and engaging in a coherent analytical framework, which AI struggles to do effectively. By designing questions that require a nuanced understanding and the ability to think critically about the product, Meta aims to assess candidates in a way that is less susceptible to AI assistance.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.642\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How is OpenAI changing its interview process to adapt to the rise of AI tools?\n","Expected: OpenAI provides candidates with ChatGPT-written code and asks them to identify and fix mistakes, testing how well they can collaborate with AI instead of avoiding it.\n","Answer: OpenAI is adapting its interview process by giving candidates code generated by ChatGPT and asking them to identify mistakes in it. This approach tests candidates' ability to work with AI, specifically their skills in spotting errors and improving upon AI-generated solutions. The logic behind this change is that if AI is part of the job, candidates should be evaluated on how effectively they can collaborate with AI tools. This shift reflects a broader trend among companies, including OpenAI, to incorporate AI into the hiring process and assess candidates' proficiency in using these technologies.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.837\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What unintended consequence has emerged as companies retreat to methods they believe cannot be faked by AI?\n","Expected: Interviews have become significantly harder, with companies raising the bar and returning to pedigree-based screening, making it more difficult for entry-level talent to break in.\n","Answer: As companies retreat to methods they believe cannot be faked by AI, one unintended consequence that has emerged is the creation of harder and harder interview problem sets. Companies are designing custom problems that AI can solve, which makes coding interviews significantly more challenging for candidates who are not using AI. Additionally, there has been a shift towards behavioral interviews, which are seen as cheat-proof, leading to a situation where 90% of the differentiation for senior roles now comes from behavioral and leadership assessments rather than coding ability. This shift has also resulted in a more complicated team matching process, which has become a hidden filter, causing many candidates to lose offers if they do not successfully match with a team.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.639\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the coach say most resumes fail to get interviews?\n","Expected: Because candidates present responsibilities instead of results, making their resumes read like job descriptions rather than showing measurable impact.\n","Answer: The coach, Danielle Bradley, states that most resumes fail to get interviews because they follow outdated advice and focus too much on listing responsibilities rather than showcasing results. She emphasizes that hiring managers are more interested in the outcomes and impact that candidates have delivered in their previous roles. Resumes that read like job descriptions, filled with passive statements about responsibilities, do not capture attention. Instead, candidates should clearly articulate the results they have achieved, which will make their applications stand out and increase their chances of landing interviews.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.663\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What example does the coach give to demonstrate transforming weak bullets into strong results?\n","Expected: She compares 'managed marketing campaigns' with 'led five marketing campaigns that generated $2.3M in revenue, exceeding targets by 34%', showing the power of specific impact.\n","Answer: The coach provides an example of resilience through a personal story about auditioning for an orchestra. He shares that he practiced hard to join a prestigious orchestra during his senior year of college but was not selected after the auditions. Initially upset, he received a call a week later from the orchestra director, who informed him that there was a need for violists. The coach was offered another chance to re-audition if he was willing to learn the viola over the summer. This story illustrates how he transformed a setback (not being selected) into a new opportunity by adapting and showing resilience.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.193\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the coach argue that mid-career professionals should use a two-page resume?\n","Expected: Because one page often cannot capture 15+ years of experience or leadership accomplishments, and a well-written two-page resume will be read word for word.\n","Answer: The coach argues that mid-career professionals should use a two-page resume because, with 15 or more years of experience, it is difficult to convey the depth of their experience and leadership on a single page. A one-page resume often fails to adequately showcase their qualifications and achievements, particularly when they have significant accomplishments, such as six-figure salaries or extensive career histories. The coach emphasizes that if the resume is filled with relevant and interesting content, hiring managers will be inclined to read it thoroughly, making a two-page format more effective for mid-career professionals.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.746\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What mistake does the coach highlight about removing older experience to avoid age discrimination?\n","Expected: She shows that removing early experience can hide important qualifications, leading recruiters to misunderstand your background or be surprised during interviews.\n","Answer: The coach highlights that the common advice to only include the last 10 years of experience on a resume to avoid age discrimination can be detrimental. They provide examples of clients who followed this advice and struggled to gain traction in their job searches because their resumes did not reflect their full career journey. For instance, one client had significant finance experience that was not included because her resume only went back 10 years, making it impossible for her to demonstrate her qualifications for a finance role she wanted to return to. The coach emphasizes that showcasing the full career journey, including older experience, can be crucial for positioning oneself effectively for desired roles.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.543\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the coach discourage generic summary lines like 'results-driven professional'?\n","Expected: Because they are meaningless clichés; instead, she recommends specific, evidence-based summaries that show unique strengths and quantifiable accomplishments.\n","Answer: The coach discourages generic summary lines like \"results-driven professional\" because they have become overused and lack specificity, making them ineffective in helping a candidate stand out. Such phrases do not convey unique qualities or accomplishments and fail to provide tangible evidence of a candidate's capabilities. Instead, the coach emphasizes the importance of crafting a powerful summary that highlights specific achievements and results, which can effectively showcase a candidate's professional brand and attract the attention of hiring managers.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.635\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does Jeff say putting the education section above work experience is a mistake?\n","Expected: Because recruiters care much more about practical experience and actionable bullet points that show job-related ability, not academic achievements like GPA or classes.\n","Answer: Jeff states that putting the education section above the work experience section is a mistake because recruiters and hiring managers prioritize relevant work experience over educational achievements when assessing candidates. He explains that while he is proud of his GPA and SAT scores, these details do not demonstrate his ability to perform on the job. Instead, showcasing work experience, such as internships or relevant projects, allows hiring managers to visualize a candidate's qualifications and suitability for the role. By placing work experience higher on the resume, candidates can capture the attention of hiring managers more effectively.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.659\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How does Jeff illustrate the difference between 'fluffy' bullet points and impactful ones?\n","Expected: He compares vague phrases like 'assisted with project governance' with specific bullets showing outcomes, such as helping a client open a new branch in the local market.\n","Answer: Jeff illustrates the difference between 'fluffy' bullet points and impactful ones by comparing two versions of a bullet point related to his experience at KPMG. In the original version, he uses vague phrases like \"assisted with project governance\" and \"presented to a banking client,\" which do not convey the significance of his contributions. In contrast, the updated version clearly states the outcome of his actions: \"the banking client successfully opened a branch in the local market.\" This revised bullet point not only maintains the initial structure but also emphasizes the tangible result of his work, demonstrating the importance of showing impact rather than just using complex terminology. He stresses that effective communication of accomplishments is crucial for making a strong impression on potential employers.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.681\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What is Jeff’s solution for candidates who feel they lack impressive metrics?\n","Expected: He says recruiters value the effort to quantify impact — candidates should keep asking 'so what?' to uncover meaningful metrics, even small ones such as performance improvements.\n","Answer: Jeff's solution for candidates who feel they lack impressive metrics is to focus on the effort they put into quantifying their impact rather than the actual numbers themselves. He emphasizes that recruiters and hiring managers appreciate the attempt to show metrics, even if they are not impressive. For example, he shares his own experience of stating that his presentation scored 23 points higher than the class average, which, while it may seem insignificant, demonstrated his understanding of success metrics and his effort to benchmark his performance against peers. He suggests continually asking yourself \"so what?\" to derive meaningful metrics from your experiences, which can help in effectively communicating your accomplishments.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.771\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does Jeff emphasize tailoring the resume for each application?\n","Expected: Because applying to many roles with a generic resume doesn’t work; tailoring helps match skills and keywords to each job, greatly increasing interview chances.\n","Answer: Jeff emphasizes tailoring the resume for each application because it significantly improves the chances of standing out to recruiters. He notes that applying to multiple jobs with a generic resume is less effective in today's job market. By focusing on three to five relevant roles and customizing the resume for those specific positions, candidates can better align their skills and experiences with what recruiters are looking for. This targeted approach not only enhances the quality of the application but also allows candidates to incorporate relevant keywords from job descriptions, making their resumes more appealing to both applicant tracking systems and human readers.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.788\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What example does Jeff give to show overlooked formatting issues can hurt a resume?\n","Expected: He highlights two hyphens formatted differently in his old resume, explaining that small errors create a poor first impression and can be a red flag for recruiters.\n","Answer: Jeff gives the example of two hyphens in his resume that are formatted differently. He emphasizes that while some may roll their eyes at such small details, first impressions matter, and easily avoidable errors like inconsistent formatting can be a red flag for recruiters. He mentions that a hiring manager once rejected a candidate solely because their resume contained a spelling mistake, highlighting the importance of attention to detail in resumes.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.808\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What mindset shift does the presenter recommend before an interview?\n","Expected: To stop thinking you must impress the company and start evaluating whether the company is right for you.\n","Answer: The presenter, Aaron Mcgoff, recommends a significant mindset shift before an interview. Instead of approaching the interview with the mindset of being grateful for the opportunity and fearing that you might not be good enough for the company, he suggests flipping that perspective. He encourages viewers to consider whether the company is good enough for them, implying that candidates should recognize their own value and see the interview as a mutual evaluation rather than a one-sided assessment. This shift can help build confidence and a more positive outlook going into the interview.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.546\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the presenter say HR is typically doing during first interviews?\n","Expected: They are filtering by checking boxes, listening for keywords, and evaluating basic traits, not deep skills.\n","Answer: The presenter explains that during first interviews, HR or hiring department representatives are typically conducting a filtering interview. They are not super familiar with the specific details of the role and are primarily looking to check off boxes on a list, which includes listening for keywords from the job description. Their focus is not on being impressed by thorough skills or knowledge, but rather on confirming that candidates meet certain criteria, such as having the required skills and showing up on time.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.614\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What should candidates do with common interview questions when preparing?\n","Expected: Script answers using keywords from the job description and practice them until they sound natural.\n","Answer: Candidates should script out their answers to the 10 to 15 most common job interview questions using keywords from the job description. This preparation helps ensure that they can repeat relevant terms that the HR or hiring department is looking for. It's important to practice these answers enough so that they sound prepared rather than scripted. This approach allows candidates to effectively communicate their qualifications while aligning with the specific requirements of the job.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.636\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How does the presenter suggest candidates approach interview anxiety?\n","Expected: By recognizing their strengths, focusing on preparation, and viewing themselves as valuable professionals.\n","Answer: The presenter suggests that candidates approach interview anxiety by taking deep breaths to oxygenate their bodies, which can help calm nerves. They emphasize the importance of preparation, such as researching the company and preparing questions to ask during the interview. This preparation can help candidates feel more confident and engaged, reducing anxiety. Additionally, the presenter reassures candidates that it's normal to feel nervous and that a little bit of nervousness can actually show that they care about the opportunity. They advise against explicitly stating nervousness during the interview, as it's understood by interviewers.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.369\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the presenter recommend preparing questions before an interview?\n","Expected: Because having questions shows genuine interest and avoids looking unprepared when asked.\n","Answer: The presenter recommends preparing questions before an interview to demonstrate curiosity and interest in the position and the company. By having questions ready, you avoid scrambling at the last minute when asked if you have any questions. This preparation helps you engage with the interviewer and shows that you are genuinely interested in the role, which can positively influence their perception of you. Additionally, asking questions can provide valuable insights about the company, such as its culture and employee satisfaction.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.63\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What breathing strategy does the presenter suggest before an interview?\n","Expected: Take deep breaths to frontload oxygen, helping to calm nerves and reduce shallow breathing.\n","Answer: The presenter suggests taking deep breaths in the minutes leading up to the interview. They explain that frontloading your body with oxygen can help you have more reserves and manage nervousness, as people tend to take shallow breaths when anxious. The presenter emphasizes the importance of not hyperventilating and encourages giving your body some oxygen to calm your nerves.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.744\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How does the presenter suggest handling lack of industry experience?\n","Expected: By connecting prior experience to relevant challenges and framing it as valuable transferable skills.\n","Answer: The presenter suggests that when facing a lack of industry experience, one should focus on storytelling and framing their existing skills and experiences in a way that highlights their relevance to the new industry. They encourage individuals to view themselves as experts who can provide valuable insights, regardless of their specific background. For example, if someone has experience in manufacturing but is applying for a role in healthcare, they can draw parallels between the challenges faced in both industries, such as frontline employee management and communication barriers. The key is to creatively articulate how their past experiences can contribute to success in the new role, emphasizing transferable skills and a strong understanding of employee engagement and collaboration. This approach allows candidates to stand out even against those with direct industry experience.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.628\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What does the presenter recommend doing after interviews to improve future responses?\n","Expected: Keep a log of questions and formulate better, more concise answers to refine performance.\n","Answer: The presenter recommends keeping a log of the questions asked during interviews and your responses to them. After each interview, you should type out a more concise version of your answers, focusing on how to express your skills and strengths more effectively. This exercise helps you revisit common questions and refine your answers for future interviews, ensuring they are brief and impactful. Additionally, the presenter emphasizes the importance of active listening during the interview to remember key points and avoid long-winded responses.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.61\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the presenter advise speaking more slowly during interviews?\n","Expected: Because it gives time to think, prevents rambling, and makes responses clearer and more confident.\n","Answer: The presenter advises speaking more slowly during interviews because it allows you more time to think and helps the listener to hear and understand what you are saying better. When nervous, people tend to talk quickly, which can lead to rushing through answers and not conveying thoughts clearly. By speaking slowly, you can emphasize certain words, create pauses for emphasis, and communicate more effectively, similar to how you would talk comfortably with friends. This approach not only improves clarity but also helps to manage anxiety during the interview process.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.57\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What are behavioral interview questions typically designed to reveal?\n","Expected: They are designed to reveal qualities and behaviors like leadership, resilience, teamwork, or ethics.\n","Answer: Behavioral interview questions are typically designed to reveal certain qualities and competencies that employers are looking for in candidates. These questions ask candidates to provide examples from their past experiences that demonstrate their abilities in areas such as leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. The interviewer is interested in understanding how the candidate has handled specific situations in the past, which can indicate how they might perform in the future. Overall, these questions aim to assess the candidate's fit for the role and their potential for growth within the company.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.559\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why should candidates prepare multiple stories for behavioral questions?\n","Expected: So they can answer different questions without repeating the same story or improvising under pressure.\n","Answer: Candidates should prepare multiple stories for behavioral questions to ensure they have a variety of examples to draw from during an interview. This preparation helps avoid situations where they might use up their only relevant story for a particular quality, such as leadership or persuasion, and then be caught off guard when asked to provide another example of the same quality. By having at least two stories for each quality, candidates can confidently respond to different questions without scrambling to come up with something on the spot, thereby presenting themselves as more prepared and thoughtful. This strategy also allows them to demonstrate a range of experiences and skills, making them more appealing to interviewers.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.548\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What storytelling method does the presenter recommend for structuring responses?\n","Expected: The STAR framework: situation, task, action, and result.\n","Answer: The presenter recommends using the STAR framework for structuring responses in behavioral interviews. The STAR framework consists of four components: \n","\n","1. **Situation** - Setting the context and providing background information.\n","2. **Task** - Describing what you were asked to do.\n","3. **Action** - Explaining the actions you took in response to the task.\n","4. **Result** - Sharing the outcome of your actions.\n","\n","The goal is to create a cohesive narrative that flows seamlessly, making it clear to the listener what qualities you demonstrated through your experience. Additionally, the presenter emphasizes the importance of synthesizing the story by concluding with a statement about what you learned from the experience, which ties everything together.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.669\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why is it important to 'show not tell' during interview stories?\n","Expected: Because demonstrating qualities through narrative is more persuasive than simply claiming them.\n","Answer: It is important to 'show not tell' during interview stories because this approach makes your experiences more engaging and relatable to the interviewer. Instead of simply stating facts or feelings, showing involves using vivid details and storytelling techniques that illustrate your experiences. This method captivates the audience and helps them connect with your narrative on a deeper level.\n","\n","For example, instead of saying, \"I felt upset when my boss told me I messed up,\" you could say, \"My boss told me that I messed up, and the first thought that came to my mind was, 'Boy, am I screwed.'\" This second version conveys the pressure and emotional weight of the situation, making it more impactful. \n","\n","Ultimately, effective storytelling helps you stand out among many candidates, as it provides a compelling reason for the interviewer to pay attention to your unique experiences and insights. It also allows you to demonstrate qualities like leadership or resilience through concrete examples, rather than just stating them, which can leave a stronger impression.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.604\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How does adding a 'what I learned' component improve an interview response?\n","Expected: It synthesizes the story and makes clear what growth occurred, reinforcing the desired quality.\n","Answer: Adding a 'what I learned' component to an interview response improves the overall effectiveness of the answer by synthesizing the experience and highlighting personal growth. It helps to tie the story together, making it clear to the interviewer what the candidate took away from the experience. This not only demonstrates self-reflection but also shows that the candidate can learn from challenges and setbacks, which is a valuable trait in any role. By articulating the lessons learned, candidates can effectively communicate their ability to overcome difficulties and adapt, thereby making their responses more compelling and memorable. This approach also clarifies the key points of the story, ensuring that the interviewer understands the significance of the experience in relation to the qualities being assessed.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.474\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the presenter advise against saying 'what would I do in this role?'\n","Expected: Because it suggests the candidate didn’t read the job description or prepare adequately.\n","Answer: The presenter advises against saying \"what would I do in this role?\" because it suggests that the candidate has not done their homework or read the job description. This question can make interviewers wonder if the candidate is genuinely interested in the position or if they are prepared for the interview. Instead, the presenter recommends asking a more informed question, such as expressing that they have read the job description and spoken to someone in the department, and then asking for the interviewer's perspective on the day-to-day responsibilities of the role. This approach demonstrates preparation and genuine interest in the position.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.476\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How should candidates ask about salary to avoid sounding unprofessional?\n","Expected: By asking for a range politely and framing it as wanting to avoid wasting anyone’s time.\n","Answer: Candidates should approach the topic of salary with care to avoid sounding unprofessional. Instead of directly asking, \"How much does this pay?\" or \"What would my salary be?\", they can frame their question in a more considerate way. For example, they might say, \"I know if we proceed with this interview process, it can be a long journey, and I would hate to waste anyone's time. Would you be able to provide a bit of the salary range before we move forward?\" This approach shows that the candidate is mindful of both their own needs and the interviewer's time, making it a more professional inquiry. Additionally, it's important to consider the timing of the question, ideally asking at the end of an interview or during a phone screen when appropriate.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.53\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why does the presenter discourage badmouthing former employers in interviews?\n","Expected: It can reflect poorly on the candidate and raise concerns about their professionalism.\n","Answer: The presenter discourages badmouthing former employers in interviews because it can create a negative impression of the candidate. They compare it to a first date where someone talks excessively about their ex; it raises questions about the candidate's judgment and maturity. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of a past boss, the candidate should discuss specific situations in a sophisticated manner, explaining why they weren't a good fit and how the new opportunity aligns better with their goals. This approach helps maintain professionalism and allows the interviewer to assess the candidate's character without bias from past experiences.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.564\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What risk does saying 'I really need this job' pose in an interview?\n","Expected: It may make the candidate seem desperate instead of motivated and aligned with the role.\n","Answer: Saying \"I really need this job\" in an interview poses the risk of coming across as desperate rather than passionate or enthusiastic about the role. It can signal to the interviewer that you are not genuinely interested in the position for its own merits, but rather out of necessity. This can detract from your overall presentation and may lead the interviewer to question your confidence and suitability for the role. Instead, it's advised to express excitement for the opportunity and focus on what specifically about the role excites you, rather than emphasizing your personal need for employment.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.569\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why should candidates avoid admitting they haven't used a company's product?\n","Expected: Because it suggests a lack of preparation and interest in the company or industry.\n","Answer: Candidates should avoid admitting they haven't used a company's product because it can signal a lack of interest or passion for the industry or the specific role they are applying for. When candidates say they haven't used the product or service, it may come across as unpreparedness or disconnection from the company's mission and values. Employers often look for candidates who demonstrate familiarity and enthusiasm for their products, as it reflects a genuine interest in the company and its offerings. Therefore, it's advisable for candidates to at least familiarize themselves with the company's products before an interview, or to refrain from making negative statements about their experience with them.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.544\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: Why is it important to avoid simply repeating your resume in a self-introduction?\n","Expected: Because interviewers already know your history and want to understand your strengths and personality.\n","Answer: It is important to avoid simply repeating your resume in a self-introduction because doing so can make you sound generic and unremarkable. Hiring managers often skim through resumes, and if your introduction mirrors the resume without adding any unique insights or specific achievements, it may fail to capture their attention. Instead, you should focus on highlighting your unique qualifications and the impact of your experiences. This approach not only differentiates you from other candidates but also allows you to present yourself as a results-driven professional, showcasing tangible accomplishments that are relevant to the role you are applying for. By doing this, you create a more compelling narrative that can engage the listener and make a stronger impression.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.443\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How should candidates explain gaps or unfinished education in interviews?\n","Expected: Honestly and clearly, showing reflection and how the experience contributed to their development.\n","Answer: Candidates can explain gaps or unfinished education in interviews by focusing on their relevant skills and experiences rather than dwelling on the gaps themselves. They should frame their narrative to highlight how their past experiences, even if not directly related to the job, have equipped them with valuable skills. For instance, they can emphasize transferable skills gained from previous roles, such as teamwork, problem-solving, or adaptability.\n","\n","Additionally, candidates can use storytelling techniques to present their journey positively. They might say something like, \"While I haven't completed my degree yet, I've gained practical experience in [specific area] that has prepared me well for this role.\" This approach allows candidates to acknowledge their educational status while simultaneously showcasing their strengths and enthusiasm for the position. \n","\n","Building rapport with the interviewer can also be beneficial. By establishing a connection and demonstrating soft skills, candidates can create a more favorable impression, making it easier for interviewers to overlook gaps in education or experience.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.422\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What should candidates highlight when discussing why they want a job?\n","Expected: Their motivation, relevant skills, and how they align with the role and work environment.\n","Answer: Candidates should focus on expressing their excitement and enthusiasm for the opportunity rather than personal financial needs. They should articulate what specifically about the role excites them and why they are passionate about it. For example, instead of saying, \"I really need this job,\" they could say, \"I'm really excited for this opportunity because...\" and then elaborate on aspects of the role that align with their interests and skills. This approach helps convey genuine interest and passion without sounding desperate. Additionally, candidates should avoid mentioning nerves directly, as interviewers are already aware that candidates may feel nervous. Showing a little bit of nerves can be healthy, as it indicates that the candidate cares about the position.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.454\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: How can candidates effectively describe accomplishments?\n","Expected: By using specific examples and connecting them to strengths that would benefit the employer.\n","Answer: Candidates can effectively describe their accomplishments by following a structured approach that emphasizes impact and results. Here are some key strategies:\n","\n","1. **Use Specific Metrics**: Incorporate numbers, percentages, or dollar amounts to quantify achievements. For example, instead of saying \"increased sales,\" specify \"increased regional sales by 25% in one year.\"\n","\n","2. **Claim Evidence Approach**: Start with a clear claim about your achievement, followed by evidence that supports it. For instance, you might say, \"Exceeded annual sales quotas,\" and then provide specific figures, such as \"achieved $22 million against a goal of $20 million in 2020.\"\n","\n","3. **Highlight Business Impact**: Focus on the results of your work. Companies want to know how your contributions saved money, increased profits, or improved productivity. For example, instead of vague responsibilities, describe how your actions led to a successful outcome, like \"the banking client successfully opened a branch in the local market.\"\n","\n","4. **Avoid Generic Language**: Steer clear of buzzwords and generic phrases. Instead, use concrete examples that illustrate your unique contributions and the value you brought to previous roles.\n","\n","5. **Craft a Compelling Professional Summary**: Begin with a clear statement of your professional identity, followed by a value proposition that includes specific achievements. For example, \"Experienced marketing manager with a proven track record in digital marketing, having successfully led a campaign that boosted social media engagement by 40%.\"\n","\n","By implementing these strategies, candidates can create a more impactful and compelling narrative around their accomplishments, making their resumes stand out to hiring teams.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.56\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What approach should candidates take when asked about weaknesses?\n","Expected: State a real weakness and explain how they are working to improve it, without contradicting earlier claims.\n","Answer: While the specific videos do not directly address how to answer questions about weaknesses, they emphasize the importance of preparation and self-awareness in interviews. Candidates should consider the following approach based on the context provided:\n","\n","1. **Self-Reflection**: Before the interview, candidates should conduct a \"brain dump\" of their experiences, including any weaknesses they have encountered. This helps in identifying areas for improvement.\n","\n","2. **Framing Weaknesses Positively**: When discussing weaknesses, candidates can frame them in a way that shows they are aware of their limitations and are actively working to improve. For example, they might mention a weakness and then explain the steps they are taking to address it.\n","\n","3. **Keep It Brief**: Similar to other interview responses, candidates should aim to keep their answers concise, ideally within two minutes. This ensures they remain focused and do not dwell too long on the negative.\n","\n","4. **Active Listening**: During the interview, candidates should listen carefully to the questions being asked. This allows them to tailor their responses more effectively and ensure they are addressing the interviewer's concerns.\n","\n","5. **Learning from Past Experiences**: Candidates should view past interview experiences, including those where they felt they did not perform well, as learning opportunities. This mindset can help them approach questions about weaknesses with a constructive attitude.\n","\n","By preparing thoughtfully and framing their weaknesses as areas for growth, candidates can present themselves as self-aware and proactive individuals.\n","Cosine similarity: 0.511\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Average semantic similarity:
