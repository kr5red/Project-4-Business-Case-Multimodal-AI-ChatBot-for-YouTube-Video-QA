interview has got to be one of the most nerve-wracking things you'll do and so I want to give you three different tips on what you could do to crush your next job interview from an employer point of view not the employee because I've done hundreds if not thousands of interviews and I can tell you what worked and what didn't work so let's get right into it think about the three steps as before the interview during the interview and after the interview let's first talk about before the interview I the employer loved it when the person wanted to get the job has done a research on the company for instance I said what a person did that then I was interviewing them they were hiring for a CFO position with our company the amount of research this person had done was so impressive I can't even tell you he knew stories articles employees leaders challenges everything so I'm sinners saying this is how this person does research imagine if they work with us how much research they're gonna do on systems we need technologies we need this is very impressive I like this guy and so before him coming for the interview I got an email on LinkedIn saying my name is such-and-such I notice your inner your job posting I am really looking for the meeting with you on the CFO position for this company and we met I was very impressed by him okay so step number one do a lot of research number two during the interview overselling only works if you're going on a date with a girl or a guy and by the way if you oversell yourself that relationships gonna be a very short sale you gotta be kind of honest about what you're doing with the business and who you are so I sat with somebody and I said how much you know about this have to be honest with you I don't know a lot about this but I can tell you what I know a lot about boom boom boom what that told me what this person is I'm getting somebody that's gonna be very direct very honest and they know what they don't know they know what they do no wonder geyser was interviewing he said look this software I don't know about these areas I am very good at but with this all I need to do is go to a one-week course and I would get very good at this because one thing about me is I don't want the fastest learners I know and I can't wait to introduce that to you good I like that okay so don't oversell your superior self and find a way to match the mead with what your values and principles and what would your gifts and strengths that you bring in match those two together let me give you the last one you after the interview I had seven job interviews I did last week that I was looking for right only one of them messaged me back afterwards and said the following they said thank you so much for your time today and by the way this was the most qualified one out of all of them how impressive is this the person that's the most qualified who has worked with the biggest account as the most qualified person for this position was the only one that sent me the email and he said I just want you to I really enjoyed our time together I am the person you want not only do I want this job I am really looking forward to this because I can see myself bringing on a lot of value to the company I hope I get a chance to meet with you on a second interview regardless I wish you all the best sincerely dah dah dah I said you know what purely classy on a message like this it made me when we set then as the employer when we sat down on our board meeting and the investors and everybody was looking at everybody and they had already done the reference calls they said who are you impressed with I said well the only person that sent me a note afterwards was this person so I want you to think about it when you're going on your next job interview think about the before why because it separates you from everybody else if you do your research think about your during con overselling why because it gives you credibility with the person you're working with knowing you're forthright and there's not gonna be any surprises because if you oversell and we work and we realize you were over selling you get fired fast and you don't want to get fired fights because that doesn't look good on a resume and last but not least on the after send that note why because only a few people do it those three tips are the tips I got for you to go out and crush your next job interview [Music] you [Music]\",\n          \"One of the most important parts of a job application is the job interview. In this video you will learn what you can expect from an interview and get useful tips to help you prepare better. The job interview starts right at the first impression. Imagine you have arrived on time and you're ready to greet your new employer: how do you do this? Research shows that smiling, eye contact and giving a firm handshake are crucial for a good first impression. For example, people with a strong handshake are generally better appraised. During the interview, your nonverbal communication remains very important. Examples are an active sitting position and making eye contact with each person in the room. The following three topics are almost always discussed during the job interview: 1) Your life course: by asking questions about your background and experience, the employer tries to get a clearer image of you; what have you done in your life, why? What kind of person are you and what qualities do you have? 2) Your motivation: the employer will also ask questions about your motivation. Why do you want to work with this organization? Why does this position appeal to you? It is important that you have a thoughtful answer to these questions. Your motivation also becomes apparent from the knowledge that you have about the company and its activities. 3) competencies: the employer wants to know if you have the skills and personal characteristics that are needed for the job. You demonstrate these by using the STAR-method. The employer also evaluates during the conversation whether he or she will work well with you and whether you will fit into the team. An employer will be more likely to select you when there is a good conversation dynamic. One way to achieve this is by giving short and powerful answers. The interviewer can then ask follow-up questions where necessary. Try to engage in conversation with all the interview attendants by asking them questions during, or at the end of the conversation. In order to focus on your conversation partners and your nonverbal communication, you need to be well prepared. Below you'll find an overview of the most frequently asked questions during a job interview. When you can give a thoughtful answer to each question, you know that you are well prepared. This enables you to focus on having the best possible conversation. Try practicing with a friend who plays the role of the interviewer. Well, now we have discussed what you can expect during a job interview and what you can do to increase your success rate. If you want more detailed information, please find it below.
